In process:
life cycle

Next:
life cycle:
    basic eat;
    grab forks;
    release forks;
    full sleep;
    full eat;
    full think;
include the struct arg_parse into t_program to use the int *arr
init_threads
start_simulation
test
Split into files

Done:
init_cross_mutex
init_forks
init_program with args
init_philos
printf_mutex
set-up simulation
life cycle:
    basic philo_sleep
    basic philo_think
    think after sleep


WISH to
check if all the structs are malloc correctly and !malloc error



LEFT FORK = index i 
RIGHT FORK = index (i + 1)%N then the last philo will take first the right
